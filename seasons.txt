		Seasons
In the mid of summer, when the heat of sun dances in the air,
a chill breeze refreshes, carrying the droplets of water from the cloud.
The mix of mighty sun's ray with the gracious drizzle, 
projects a pretty picture named rainbow in the sky.
In the mid of work routine, when the thoughts of toil dances in the mind,
a calm detour of meditation, hobby and art refreshes, clearing the fog inside the head.
The mix of intense focus with a compassionate service for others,
illuminates a bright picture with a meaning in life.
